This code implements the method described in Ch 18 of the book “Recursive Macroeconomic Theory”  [RMT]  by L. Ljungvist and T. Sargent for calculating the equilibrium in Huggett's benchmark pure-exchange economy with no shared risk. The model parameters are borrowed from  [RMT]  and the output is illustrated.
