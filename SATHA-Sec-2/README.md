This code implements the method described in Ch 18 of the book “Recursive Macroeconomic Theory” [RMT] by L. Ljungvist and T. Sargent for calculating the equilibrium in Huggett's benchmark pure-exchange economy with no shared risk. The model parameters are borrowed from the book [RMT] and the output is illustrated.

N.B.: The~Julia program included here emulates the MATLAB code that accompanies [RMT], except in the following step: in the original MATLAB code the iterations of the Bellman equation stop after the first repetition of the policy function, whereas in the program included here the iterations are terminated after the first simultaneous repetition of both the policy function and the value function (within a prescribed threshold), not just after the first repetition of the policy function. This modification of the stopping criterion is necessary because, due to the discretization of the state space, the value function can still improve after the first repetition of the policy function, if the former has not yet converged to its time-invariant state. Just as in [RMT], the stationary distribution of the private state is obtained by iterating equation (18.2.4) in [RMT] (essentially, a discrete analog of the Fokker-Planck/Kolmogorov-forward equation for the private state) from the uniform distribution. The main reason for translating the original code into Julia is the ability of this more recent platform to handle much larger grid sizes.
