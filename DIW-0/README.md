This code implements the alternative algorithm described in Sec. 3 of  [DIW]  and yields a numerically verifiable equilibrium for the pure-echnage economy with no aggregate risk borrowed from [RMT]. The output from the code included here is benchmarked against the output from the code included in the RMT direcory.
